Climate change research has shown significant warming trends over the past century. Temperature records from weather stations worldwide indicate an average global temperature increase of approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times.

The methodology for climate studies involves analyzing ice core data, tree ring patterns, and satellite measurements. Statistical models are used to project future climate scenarios based on greenhouse gas emission patterns.

Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased from 315 ppm in 1958 to over 420 ppm in 2023. This represents a 33% increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, primarily attributed to fossil fuel combustion and deforestation.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides comprehensive assessments of climate science. Their reports synthesize research from thousands of scientists worldwide to inform policy decisions.

Mitigation strategies include renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency improvements, and carbon capture technologies. Adaptation measures focus on building resilience to climate impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather events.

Economic analysis suggests that the costs of climate action are significantly lower than the costs of inaction. Investment in clean technologies is projected to generate positive returns while reducing environmental risks.

International cooperation through agreements like the Paris Climate Accord aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. This requires rapid decarbonization of energy systems and substantial changes in land use practices.
